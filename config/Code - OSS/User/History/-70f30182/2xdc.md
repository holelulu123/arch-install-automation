# SDR MOCK
This project is supposed to mimic the SDR service (node) and send packets to the server.
We simulate in here an outdoor enviorment with various parameters like:
    - Bandwidth
    - Number of packets
    - Time of signal
    - Different delta T to change position of Transmitter

# How to Start
1. install virtual enviorment
